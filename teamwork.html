                <h2>Introduction to AI</h2>
                <p>Most people are now familiar with artificial intelligence, or AI, thanks to a steady stream of news reports and (often alarmist) think pieces. AI essentially refers to any technology that mimics human interaction and intelligence, such as speech recognition, reasoning, decision-making, and pattern identification. It can also refer to the entire field of research dedicated to these technologies.</p>

                <h2>AI in the Workplace</h2>
                <p>AI systems use algorithms to solve complex problems and automate simple or repetitive tasks. In the workplace, AI technology is employed in various ways to reduce human error, save money, and make better, data-driven decisions for the entire organization. Essentially, workplace AI is quickly becoming a competitive necessity.</p>
                <p>In 2022, a Deloitte Insights survey found that 91% of business leaders report having an enterprise-wide AI strategy, focusing on areas like generating insights, lowering costs, improving collaboration, and optimizing processes.</p>
                <p>“While AI adoption rates and maturity vary widely across industries, AI is driving new levels of efficiency and performance for businesses of all sizes,” says Deloitte’s Irfan Saif, U.S. AI co-leader, Deloitte Risk & Financial Advisory. “Organizations have the opportunity to unlock the full potential of AI when they embrace it and deploy it at scale throughout their enterprise.”</p>
